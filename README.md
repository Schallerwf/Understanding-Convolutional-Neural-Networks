# Understanding-Neural-Networks
An attempt to understand in a deep yet simple way how and why neural networks work.

## Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
A dead simple CNN implemented in caffe that I call 'SimpleNet'. A great playground for playing around with hyperparameters.  

## Understanding-Networks-As-Matrices
A java implementation of http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/. Exercise in implementing all of the math operations in an attempt to better understand them.
