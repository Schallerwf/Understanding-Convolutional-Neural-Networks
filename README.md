# Understanding-Neural-Networks
An attempt to understand in a deep yet simple way how and why neural networks work.

## Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
A very simple CNN implemented in caffe that I call 'SimpleNet'. A great playground for playing around with hyperparameters.

This example uses a python script to generate simple labeled datasets of different shapes and colors. Caffe can then be trained to classify these datasets in just 2 to 5 minutes. Starting with a simple example that can be trained in minutes is a great way to learn how hyperparameters change networks. 

## Understanding-Networks-As-Matrices
Inspired by http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/, this example is a java implementation of 2 layer feed forward neural network. This sample does not use any libraries and instead implements all matrix math needed for a neural network in 149 lines of Java.
